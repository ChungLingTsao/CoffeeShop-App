# CoffeeShop-App

## Overview 

Group project where a coffee shop needed an application for purchasing coffees, without needing to transfer any 
money at the point of sale.

The Agile Scrum methodologies were utilised for the project framework where we develop the product for the customer, and adjust to changes throughout development.

This application was coded using Xamarin for release on Android.
